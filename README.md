# VILLAGE STORIES - Complete YouTube Video Production Checklist

## 📹 PHASE 1: PRE-PRODUCTION & SHOOTING

### Before Shooting:
- [ ] **Plan your content** - Decide the village story/topic (festivals, farming, cooking, daily life, crafts, etc.)
- [ ] **Scout location** - Check lighting, background noise, and interesting backdrops
- [ ] **Charge all equipment** - Phone/camera, backup battery, power bank
- [ ] **Clean camera lens** - Use soft cloth
- [ ] **Check storage space** - Ensure enough space for recording
- [ ] **Plan golden hours** - Shoot during early morning (6-9 AM) or evening (4-7 PM) for best natural light

### During Shooting:
- [ ] **Shoot in landscape mode** (horizontal) - Never vertical for YouTube
- [ ] **Use highest resolution** - 1080p minimum, 4K if possible
- [ ] **Record at 30fps or 60fps** - Consistent frame rate
- [ ] **Hold phone/camera steady** - Use both hands or tripod
- [ ] **Multiple angles** - Get wide shots, medium shots, and close-ups
- [ ] **B-roll footage** - Capture extra clips of village scenery, activities, details (at least 20-30 seconds each)
- [ ] **Record clean audio** - Minimize wind noise, use external mic if possible
- [ ] **Get 5-10 seconds extra** - Start recording before action, end after
- [ ] **Shoot intro/outro separately** - You talking to camera introducing the topic
- [ ] **Capture candid moments** - Natural reactions make great content
- [ ] **Test shots** - Review first few clips for focus, lighting, audio
